 1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? Which articles have been accessed the most? Present this information as a sorted list with the most popular article at the top.

Example:

"Princess Shellfish Marries Prince Handsome" — 1201 views
"Baltimore Ravens Defeat Rhode Island Shoggoths" — 915 views
"Political Scandal Ends In Political Scandal" — 553 views
solution
------------------
select (select title from articles where concat('/article/',slug) like path) as title, COUNT(*)as amount from log where path like '/article/%' group by path ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC limit 3

2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with the most popular author at the top.

solution
------------------
SELECT au.name,SUM (amount) AS total FROM
(select path, COUNT(*)as amount from log where path like '/article/%' group by path ORDER BY COUNT(*) desc) as b,authors as au, articles as ar 
where concat('/article/',ar.slug) like b.path and ar.author=au.id group by au.name order by SUM (amount) desc

Example:

Ursula La Multa — 2304 views
Rudolf von Treppenwitz — 1985 views
Markoff Chaney — 1723 views
Anonymous Contributor — 1023 views


3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors? The log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status code that the news site sent to the user's browser. (Refer to this lesson for more information about the idea of HTTP status codes.)
Example:

select a._date as _date,(a.error*1.0/b.ok)*100.0 as requestsErrors
from 
(SELECT DATE(time) as _date, count(*) as error
from log where status!='200 OK' group by DATE(time))as a
join 
 (SELECT DATE(time) as _date, count(*) as ok
from log where status='200 OK' group by DATE(time)) as b
on a._date=b._date
where ((a.error*1.0/b.ok)*100.0)>1.0

Vagrant changes for DB accesss from host
----------------------------------------------------
Configure Postgres

Update postgresql.conf to use listen_addresses = '*'
Be sure to sudo service postgresql restart

Configure Vagrant
Add config.vm.network :forwarded_port, host: 5432, guest: 5432 to the Vagrant.configure block in your Vagrantfile.

Test your connection
